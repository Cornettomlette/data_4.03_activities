# 4.03 Activity 1

1. In the following example, the numbers are not formatted well. As you might see, there is some misalignment in terms of spaces. How will you extract all the phone numbers?

```python
text = """
Aeromexico 800 - 237 - 6639
Air Canada 888- 247-2262
Air Canada Rouge 888-247-2262
Air Creebec 800-567-6567
Air Inuit 800-361-2965
Air North 800-661-0407
Air Tindi 888-545-6794"""
```

2. Find all names in the text provided. The output should look like `['KerraPower', 'Bill Gates', 'China', 'Trump']`

```python
text = '''TKerraPower, A nuclear-energy company founded by Bill Gates,
        is unlikely to follow through on building a demonstration reactor in China,
        due largely to the Trump administrationï¿½s crackdown on the country'''

```
